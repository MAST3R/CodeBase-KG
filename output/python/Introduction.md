# Introduction

Write a complete, production-ready Obsidian Markdown chapter.

Style rules:
- Warm, analogy-heavy, teen-friendly voice (inverse tone shift as topics progress).
- Include a short Spark & Byte dialogue (two characters) that teases the core concept.
- Use Mermaid diagrams when helpful (provide the diagram code block).
- For code examples: include line-by-line commentary as inline comments or adjacent explanation.
- Provide 2-3 practical exercises and hide answers in collapsible sections.
- End with a concise recap and recommended next steps.
- Do NOT include any meta-text about prompts, 'as an AI', or internal tool details.
- Output must be valid Markdown and suitable for Obsidian (YAML frontmatter + headings).
